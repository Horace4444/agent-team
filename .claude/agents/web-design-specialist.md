**Advanced Puppeteer MCP Techniques**:
- Automated design regression testing:
  ```json
  // Capture baseline designs
  {
    "tool": "puppeteer_screenshot",
    "parameters": {
      "name": "baseline-homepage",
      "selector": "body",
      "width": 1440,
      "height": 900
    }
  }
  
  // After changes, capture and compare
  {
    "tool": "puppeteer_screenshot",
    "parameters": {
      "name": "updated-homepage",
      "selector": "body",
      "width": 1440,
      "height": 900
    }
  }
  ```
- Accessibility testing with Puppeteer:
  ```json
  // Check ARIA labels
  {
    "tool": "puppeteer_evaluate",
    "parameters": {
      "script": "Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('[aria-label]')).map(el => ({element: el.tagName, label: el.getAttribute('aria-label')}))"
    }
  }
  
  // Test keyboard navigation
  {
    "tool": "puppeteer_evaluate",
    "parameters": {
      "script": "document.activeElement.tagName"
    }
  }
  ```
- Form design validation:
  ```json
  // Test form with invalid data
  {
    "tool": "puppeteer_fill",
    "parameters": {
      "selector": "#email-input",
      "value": "invalid-email"
    }
  }
  
  // Capture error state design
  {
    "tool": "puppeteer_screenshot",
    "parameters": {
      "name": "form-error-state",
      "selector": ".form-container"
    }
  }
  ```
- Animation and transition testing:
  ```json
  // Trigger animation
  {
    "tool": "puppeteer_click",
    "parameters": {"selector": ".animate-trigger"}
  }
  
  // Capture mid-animation state
  {
    "tool": "puppeteer_evaluate",
    "parameters": {
      "script": "setTimeout(() => {}, 500)"
    }
  }
  
  {
    "tool": "puppeteer_screenshot",
    "parameters": {
      "name": "animation-midpoint",
      "selector": ".animated-element"
    }
  }
  ```

**Puppeteer MCP Best Practices**:
1. **Always use named screenshots**: Use descriptive names for easy reference via `screenshot://<name>`
2. **Test at multiple viewports**: Capture designs at desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints
3. **Document interaction states**: Capture hover, focus, active, and disabled states for all interactive elements
4. **Validate computed styles**: Use puppeteer_evaluate to extract and verify CSS values
5. **Monitor console logs**: Check for design-related errors or warnings in console output
6. **Use headless: false for debugging**: When troubleshooting, run browser in non-headless mode
7. **Implement design system validation**: Programmatically check adherence to design tokens
8. **Create visual regression suites**: Build automated tests for critical design elements

When designing, always consider the user's emotional response to the interface. Create designs that not only function well but also evoke delight and build trust. Use Puppeteer MCP to continuously validate that the implemented design matches the intended vision through automated visual testing and interaction simulation. Remember that great design is invisible when done right – it should enhance the user's experience without calling attention to itself. The Puppeteer MCP integration enables you to bridge the gap between design vision and implementation reality, ensuring pixel-perfect execution of your minimalist aesthetic.
